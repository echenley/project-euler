In England there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p)

How many different ways can £2 (200p) be made using any number of coins?

COINS = [200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1]

def coin_loop(type,subtotal)          # recursive loop from higher value coins to lower
  sub_combos = 0
  subtotal += COINS[type]             # adds current coin to subtotal
  return 1 if subtotal == COINS[0]    # returns 1 to combos if 200 is reached
  for x in type..(COINS.length-1)     # otherwise adds another coin, and so on...
    sub_combos += coin_loop(x,subtotal) if subtotal + COINS[x] <= COINS[0]
  end
  return sub_combos                   # returns accumulated sub_combos
end

combos = 0

for type in 0..(COINS.length-1)       # picks starting coin
  combos += coin_loop(type,0)
  p [type,combos]
end
